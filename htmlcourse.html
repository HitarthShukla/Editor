                    Chapter 1 Intoduction to the HTML

The full form of HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language.HTML is a markup 
language that defines the structure of your content.HTML consists of 
a series of elements, which you use to enclose,or wrap, different pa
rts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain
way.The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhe
re else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller,an
d so on.

HTML is the most basic building block & language of the Web.It defin
es the meaning and structure of web content.HTML is the code that is
used to structure a web page and its content.It is also used to crea
te websites.We use HTML tags to define look & feel of a website.With
understanding of these tags and How to put them together, we can cre
ate beautiful websites easily! For example,content could be structur
ed within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using i
mages and data tables. As the title suggests,this course will give y
ou a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

Q) Then why HTML only! Why CSS & Java Script not!
ANS
HTML is used for defining layout of a page structure a page - A bare
bone page structure CSS is used to add styling to that barebone page
created using HTML.Java Script is used to program Logic for the page
layout eg What happens when a user hovers on a text, when to hide or
show elements etc.,

•A Beautiful Analogy:
HTML= Car body (Only Metal)
CSS	= Car Paint, decoration, etc.
JAVASCRIPT= Car engine + Interior Logic.

So we will start learning how to build beautiful layouts in this cou
rse from the basic to the advanced level

                Chapter 2- A Brief history of HTML

The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Si
nce then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The most-
widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which becam
e an official standard in December 1999.
The picture of the different versions of the HTML are bellow:

Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML
is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup lan
guages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML(Geo
graphy Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Synd
ication). Since each of these languages was written in a common langu
age (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications.Thi
s makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the-
W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML).XHTML b
ecame an official standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002.XHTML is-
very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necess
ary for all XML languages, because without it,interoperability betwee
n applications would be impossible. You'll learn more aboutthe differ
ences between HTML and XHTML.

Most pages on the Web today were built using either HTML 4.01 or XHTM
L 1.0. However, in recent years, the W3C (in collaboration with anoth
er organization, the WHATWG), has been working on a brand new version
of HTML, HTML5. Currently (2011), HTML5 is still a draft specificatio
n, and is not yet an official standard. However, it is already widely
supported by browsers and other web-enabled devices, and is the way o
f the future. Therefore, HTML5 is the primary language taught in this
course.

->So where to write the code of HTML and Where to run it?
the answer of the above question is, today in the world of tech there
are so many software,text editors and IDE for the different language-
s. but we can use the simple Notepad for the HTML codes and will run-
it in the chrome. other option is to run on the IDE 's like Visual St
udio code, etc.we can go to google, type VS code and install it.

                Chapter 3  Creating our First Website part-1

we will start building a website by creating a file named index.html.
index.html is a special filename which is a special filename which is
presented when the website root address is typed.
->A Basic HTML Page
<! Doctype html> --> specifies this is an html 5 doc
<html> -->root of an HTML page
<head>-->contains page metadata
<title>CodeNlrn</title>--> Contains title
</head>
<body>-->The main body of the page(rendered by the browser).
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>-->Paragraph tag
</body>-->Closing body tag
</html>

-->now lets see this HTML pages in detail:
<!doctype html> — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of
time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to ac
t as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be c
onsidered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and ot
her useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are ba
sically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. Tha
t's all you need to know for now.
<html></html> — the <html> element. This element wraps all the conten
t on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.It al
so includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the d
ocument.
<head></head> — the <head> element. This element acts as a container-
for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the
content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things-
like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in searc
h results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and-
more.
<meta charset="utf-8"> — This element sets the character set your doc
ument should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vas
t majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any t
extual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set thi
s, and it can help avoid some problems later on.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"> — This viewport e
lement ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing-
mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then
shrinking them down.
<title></title> — the <title> element. This sets the title of your pa
ge, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is lo
aded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favor
ite it.
<body></body> — the <body> element. This contains all the content tha
t you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether th
at's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever-
else.

                Chapter 4  Creating our First Website part2

A tag is like the container for either content or other HTML tags.
HTML document  ==>Browser ==>Rendered page

Notes:
1) head and body tags are children of HTML tag.
2)HTML is the parent of Head and Body tags.
3)most of the HTML elements have opening and closing tag with content
in between opening and closing tags.
4)some HTML tags have no content.These are called Empty elements eg
<br>
5)we can either use .htm or .html extension
6)you can use"Inspect Element" or "View page source " option from chr
ome to look into a website's HTML code.
7)HTML element =start tag +Content +End tag

==>Comments in HTML:
Comments in HTML are used to mark text which should not be passed. Th
ey can help document the source code. The comment tag is used to inse
rt comments in the source code. Comments are not displayed in the bro
wsers.You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you w
hen you edit the source code at a later date. This is especially usef
ul if you have a lot of code.
<!--HTML Comment-->

==>Case Senstivity
•HTML is a case insensitive language. <H1> and<h1>tags are the same.
•HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but we recommend l
owercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types l
ike XHTML.

We can add elements inside the body tag to define the page layout

•	HTML Element
Everything from starting to the ending tag
<body>-->opening tag
->content<-
</body>-->Closing tag

gs for the most important to the least least important heading.
<h1>Most important heading</h1>
<h2>Heading</h2>
<h3>Heading</h3>
<h4>Heading</h4>

<i>This is italic</i>
<u>This is underline</u>

•	br tag
The br tag is used to creat line breaks in an HTML documents. The<br>

                Chapter 7 Creating a Page layout

when we use the right tag in right place, it results in a better page
layout,better indexing by search engines ans better user experience.w
e use the following tag to get the job done

<main>		}website layout
<footer>

inside the main tag we insert the folowing tags:
<main>-->The main opening tag
<section>-->a page section
<article>-->a self contained content
<aside>-->content aside from the ontent(e.gAds etc)
</main>-->The main closing tag
creating a page lke this is not necessry but it creates a readable an
d structured layout.
also they are usefull for SEO

Link attributes
<a href="/contact">Contact us</a>-->contact page opens in same tab

tab
we can put any content inside an anchor tag(images,headings etc are a
ll allowed)
if the page is inside a directory,we need to make sure that we link t
o the correct page-->same applies to img tag as well

the <div> element.
The <div> tag also supports the Global Attributes in HTML.
________________________________________The <div> tag also supports t
    he Event Attributes in HTML.

The span tag 
span is an inline container-->Takes as much width as necessary
The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a tex
t, or a part of a document.
